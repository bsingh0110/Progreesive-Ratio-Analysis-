# Progreesive-Ratio-Analysis-
Progressive ratio (PR) studies involve a schedule of drug reinforcement delivery that is defined by an increasing response requirement for reinforcer delivery over successive sessions. These kind of studies are often used in pharmacology or behavioral science fields in order to asses drug potency or possible addiction and the subsequent behavior involved. This code specifically analyzes behavioral microstructures such as the post-reinforcement pauses (PRP) and ratio-based response rates (RBRR) during a PR study using MEDPC output text files. Utilizes pre-named MEDPC variables B, E,and I...B referring to time stamps for lever presses, E referring to time stamps for magazine entries, and I referring to time Stamps for reinforcer delivery. Variables can be edited within code to reflect alternative naming conventions, but should contain same time stamp information. Additionally, MEDPC file should list subject number (within subject field) as well as differentiating a right and left lever per subject (within MSN).
